This is just a glimpse of what I really want to make - a discussion based social network on top of ADN infrastructure
that'll actually remove all those posts that aren't conducive to a discussion. If you're a front-end or even a back-end dev
or are just interested in helping out financially in making this social network, get in touch with me...
